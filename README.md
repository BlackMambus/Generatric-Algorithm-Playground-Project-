# Generatric-Algorithm-Playground-Project-

This is an interactive tool or simulation platform where users can tweak parameters of a genetic algorithm (GA) to observe how solutions evolve over generations. It's ideal for educational demonstrations, AI experimentation, or solving real-world problems like route planning, scheduling, or game strategy optimization.

ðŸ§  Key Components
Chromosome Representation

Binary strings, real numbers, permutations depending on use case

Each chromosome encodes a candidate solution

Fitness Function

Defines how "good" a solution is

Customizable for different problem types (e.g., shortest path, best score)

Selection Methods

Roulette wheel, tournament selection, rank-based

Prioritizes high-fitness candidates for reproduction

Crossover Techniques

Single-point, multi-point, uniform crossover

Combines genetic material from parents

Mutation

Randomly alters genes to maintain diversity

Controlled by mutation probability

Generational Loop

Repeats selection â†’ crossover â†’ mutation â†’ evaluation.
